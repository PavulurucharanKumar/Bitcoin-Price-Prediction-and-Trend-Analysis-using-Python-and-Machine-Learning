# Bitcoin Price Prediction and Trend Analysis using Python and Machine Learning
# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using ML

This project analyzes historical Bitcoin price data and predicts the closing price using **Linear Regression** model.

## Dataset

- Dataset: `btccoin.csv`
- Size: 350 MB (not uploaded here due to size limit)

> Full dataset can be loaded via Google Drive (Download from the below link)
- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bgaTkFG7eiwcFz8nFtl8TbFoIc2CQ5SH/view?usp=sharing

##  Project Steps

### Step 1: Import Libraries
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- sklearn for ML models

### Step 2: Load Dataset
- Reads the CSV and removes duplicates

### Step 3: Handle Missing Values
- Imputes missing values using median for numeric columns

### Step 4: Data Visualization
- Line plot of Bitcoin closing prices over time
- Correlation heatmap of features

### Step 5: Feature Selection & Train-Test Split
- Features: Open, High, Low, Volume
- Target: Close
- Split: 80% Train / 20% Test

### Step 6: Model Training
- Trains Linear Regression

### Step 7: Evaluation
- Calculates RMSE and R² 
- Plots Actual vs Predicted values

## Model Results

| Model                  | RMSE    | R² Score |
|------------------------|---------|----------|
| Linear Regression      | 10.46   | 1.00     |

## Plots

- Time series plot of Bitcoin closing price
- Heatmap of correlations
- Scatter plots: Actual vs Predicted prices

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Upload the dataset (or use the sample part)  
3. Run each step in `Google Colab` or Jupyter

## Note

- Full dataset is too large for GitHub.  
- Upload your CSV to Google Drive and read it via Colab if needed.
